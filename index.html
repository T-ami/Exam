<title>Water and Sanitation</title>
</div>
<div>
<p>Billions of people worldwide still live without safely managed drinking water, sanitation and hygiene services, which are critical for protecting human health and containing the spread of COVID-19. Over the last century, global water use has increased at more than twice the rate of population growth. In addition to water stress, countries are facing growing challenges linked to water pollution, degraded water-related ecosystems, water scarcity caused by climate change and cooperation over transboundary waters. The world is not on track to achieve SDG 6. A dramatic acceleration in current rates of progress and integrated and holistic approaches to water management is needed.

Between 2000 and 2020, the global population using safely managed drinking water services and safely managed sanitation services increased by 2 billion and 2.4 billion, respectively. Despite progress, 2 billion people lacked safely managed drinking water services, 3.6 billion lacked safely managed sanitation services, and 2.3 billion lacked basic hygiene services in 2020. The 1 in 3 people worldwide who still lack basic handwashing facilities with soap and water at home are especially vulnerable to COVID-19.

Among the 42 countries reporting on both total wastewater generation and total wastewater treatment in 2015, 32% of total wastewater flows received at least some treatment. An estimated 56% of wastewater generated by households in 2020 was safely treated, based on data from 128 countries and territories.

Assessment of rivers, lakes and aquifers of 89 countries in 2020 shows that 60% of water bodies assessed have good water quality. Protection is easier than restoration, so efforts to protect these water bodies from pollution must be initiated now.</p>
